### Programs-As-Data
Programs as Data Evaluator

## What I Learned
- Type Annotations and Readable Code: Importance of adding explicit type annotations and using meaningful variable names to enhance code clarity and maintainability.
- Error Handling with Exceptions: Implementing exceptions like DivisionByZero, UnboundVariable, and IncorrectType to manage runtime errors in OCaml evaluators.
- Lambda Expressions and Closures: Evaluating lambda functions and creating closures, ensuring correct environment management for free variables in function bodies.
- Recursive Functions and LetRec: Implementing recursive functions using LetRec, handling self-references and recursion in a functional programming context.
- Testing and Debugging with Dune: Utilizing dune for automated testing, debugging with utop, and using assertions to ensure correctness and identify issues in OCaml programs.
